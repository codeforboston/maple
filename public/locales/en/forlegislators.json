Both our website content and the testimonies we post can be automatically translated to any language on demand, meaning that non-English speakers can write testimony in the language in which they are most comfortable and legislative offices can click a button to translate it to English. While machine translation is not perfect, it offers a big step forward in language accessibility for constituents who do not have access to expert translation."
