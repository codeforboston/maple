In Massachusetts, one way to have your voice heard is by submitting written testimony regarding specific bills. This website, the MAPLE platform, can help you submit your written testimony to the MA Legislature. However, please note that this is not an official government website and is not the only way to submit your testimony. Here are the essential things to know before submitting testimony:",

Committees are critical; they dictate whether a bill \"fails\" or whether it moves forward in the legislative process.

While the amount of time available to speak during a public hearing is limited, more detailed comments can be submitted to the committee in written testimony. All stakeholders have the chance to share their thoughts with the legislature by submitting written testimony. Typically, testimony is submitted to the committee assigned to the bill. You can also deliver oral testimony by attending a hearing or you can reach out to your legislators and speak to them directly."

This typically occurs before February of the second year of the legislative session (even-numbered years). The goal for proponents of a bill is that the Committee will recommend they \"ought to pass\" and thereby promote them out of the Committee. Most bills, however are \"sent to study,\" meaning that they will not be passed out of committee in that session. A successful bill may be redrafted or amended by the committee based on testimony received and other deliberations. Many of those bills will be refiled in the next session and can be considered again."
