    "intro": "All laws passed by state legislatures should consider feedback from residents and community stakeholders. In Massachusetts, one way to have your voice heard is by submitting written testimony regarding specific bills. This website, the MAPLE platform, can help you submit your written testimony to the MA Legislature. However, please note that this is not an official government website and is not the only way to submit your testimony. Here are the essential things to know before submitting testimony:",
