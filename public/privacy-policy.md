+ ## Information We Collect and How We Use It  
+ ---
+ ### Account Information:
+ - If you create an account, you must provide us with some Personal Information so that we can provide our services to you. 
+ - An account registered with an email address and password is required to submit testimony through MAPLE. We do this to help ensure that testimony is being submitted by a real person and reduce the amount of spam posted on the site.
  
+ ### District Information:
+ - We collect, store, and make available all district information on MAPLE, meaning your state representative and senator district information.
  
+ ### Log Information:
+ - We collect information that your computer sends whenever you visit MAPLE (Log Data). We collect this information because it is part of standard web traffic logging and analytics.
+ - Log Data may include information such as, your Internet Protocol (IP) Address, web browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your operating system and version, your language preference, the website or service that referred you to MAPLE, the date and time of each request you make to MAPLE, your screen display information, and information from any Cookies we have placed on your web browser.
+ - Log Data may be collected in our log files each time you interact with MAPLE.
+ - We use internal tools and third party applications and services (specifically, Google Analytics) to collect and analyze Log Data. 
+ - For more information on Google Analytics, please see: How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.
+ - Some of this information may be associated with the IP Address used to access MAPLE; some may be connected with your account; and some may only be collected and used in aggregate form (as a statistical measure that wouldn’t identify you or your account). 
+ - We will never share individual Log Data with third parties or publicly on MAPLE. We may share aggregated statistics such as the number of visitors over time or the number of visitors from different geographic locations to help understand the user base of MAPLE. We may analyze individual logging records to improve MAPLE operations, such as fixing bugs related to individual browser behaviors.

+ ### Cookies: 
+ - We use Cookies (small digital files stored on your device and maintained by your browser) and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services, such as to learn how often users visit MAPLE and to provide them with the ability to login automatically.

+ ### Archive:
+ - We export and use the testimony we collect on a bill page to create an archive.
+ ### Email Communications:
+ - We use your email address to verify your account and to communicate with you.
Administrative communications relating to your account (e.g., for purposes of account recovery or password reset) are considered part of your account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving. 
+ - If you opt-in to receive updates, we may also send you email notifications for status updates on bills and/or organizations you mark as followed. If you change your mind, you may then opt-out by using the “Opt-Out” link in the emails themselves. 

+ We do NOT sell your data or share any Personal Information that you have not consented to post publicly on MAPLE, other than as required by law.

+ We do NOT tailor user experiences based on Personal Information.

+ ## How Long We Keep Your Information
+ ---
+ - We keep your profile information and content for the duration of your account. 
+ - We intend to keep certain information, including your aggregated testimony, your legislators, and your account at the time it was active, indefinitely. This information does not include your email and password.
+ - If you violate our Code of Conduct and your account is suspended, we will keep the email address you used to create the account indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.

+ ## How You Can Control Your Information
+ ---
+ - You can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by editing your profile.
+ - Your profile, which includes your name, your about section, your aggregated testimony, your legislators, your Twitter username, and your LinkedIn username is hidden from public view by default. In this view, only your name appears on bills for which you give testimony. 
+ - You can allow others to see your profile, which includes your name, your about section, your aggregated testimony, your legislators, your Twitter username, and your LinkedIn username by selecting “Allow others to see your profile.” 
+ - You can choose to return to the default view at any time by deselecting “Allow others to see your profile.” 
+ - Your email and password are always hidden from public view. You can choose to share your email address by including it in the ‘about me’ section of your profile. 
+ - You can freeze your account at any time which will lock you out of your account. All your testimony will remain on the website, but your profile page featuring your aggregated testimony will be hidden. You can restore your frozen account by requesting a password reset.
