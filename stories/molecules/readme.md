> In interfaces, molecules are relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, and button can join together to create a search form molecule. <br/>
> When combined, these abstract atoms suddenly have purpose. The label atom now defines the input atom. Clicking the button atom now submits the form. The result is a simple, portable, reusable component that can be dropped in anywhere search functionality is needed.

> [C]reating simple UI molecules makes testing easier, encourages reusability, and promotes consistency throughout the interface.
> <br />
> Now we have simple, functional, reusable components that we can put into a broader context.

### what goes here?

- Simple groups of atom components that are more than the sum of their parts.
- Simple groups of atom components that as a unit performs one function. 
- Simple groups of atom components that classically 'belong' together, appear to the user as a unit, are treated in our design as a unit, and probably are reused very frequently, like a label and a form input. 


If this folder gets too big, we can sort these into subfolders by type and function.
