### what goes here

- fully assembled pages
- major modal
- user action flow series

### why include full pages?

- to make it easy for everyone to display, view, and share full pages.

- to support communication and interaction between development and design.

- to enable design sign-off contribution requirements

- to allow everyone to view all the pages of the site without having to create the conditions on the actual site, for example, create a new user in order to view the auth flow.
