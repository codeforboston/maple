The commonwealth accommodated voters by allowing them to vote by mail for any reason, which was a success and proved that Massachusetts has the infrastructure necessary to handle common sense reforms to its election laws. Election day registration is one such reform: we urge you to support (#) that would allow eligible voters in the Commonwealth to register to vote on Election Day.</p><p Style="text-indent:1cm">Election Day registration would allow more Massachusetts voters to make their voices heard, which is crucial for a healthy and functioning democracy. Currently, twenty-two states allow Election Day registration in some form. In those states, voter turnout has increased considerably upon enactment. This, in conjunction with the permanent codification of pandemic protocols, will ensure increased access to voters who might have otherwise not been able to participate in this democratic process, owing to work conflicts, health concerns, and other barriers. Relatedly, requiring registration before Election Day discourages so-called “lower propensity” voters who might miss the opportunity to vote just because they are not aware of the registration deadline. This requirement has the effect of disenfranchising those who engage with the election cycle closer to Election Day, when interest in politics is at its highest. Enacting Election Day registration allows more people the opportunity to vote, no matter when they engage with the political process.</p><p Style="text-indent:1cm">Those who oppose the adoption of same-day voter registration argue that by allowing registration to occur at any time up through and including election day, there would be insurmountable financial and administrative costs, as well as increased voter fraud.  Regarding the financial implications, Demos, a non-partisan public policy organization found in a 2009 survey of states that had already implemented election-day voter registration that costs were “minimal,” and predominantly a reallocation of existing resources to compensate for registration at polling places.   On the subject of administrative costs, the same study also found that implementation of same day voter registration, particularly on election day, drastically reduces the need for provisional ballots and saves the time and expense of processing ballots.</p><p Style="text-indent:1cm">Finally, regarding the issue of fraud--our most recent electoral cycle showed us that while concerns about fraudulent voting are high, the incidences of fraud are quite low.  Voters registering on election day would still be required to provide proof of identity and proof of residence, making the process of registration no different from that of the current process, with the exception of the deadline.</p><p Style="text-indent:1cm">In summary, while there may be some administrative or financial implications associated with implementing same day voter registration, the benefits of enfranchisement and removing barriers to democratic participation far outweigh the potential costs.  We strongly encourage you to take action immediately to bring Massachusetts into a growing group of states leading the charge around democracy reform.</p><p Style="text-indent:1cm">Signed,</p><p Style="text-indent:1cm"><i>The Good Governance Project</i></p></section></div><footer class="Layout_footer__3mkvi">Powered by Democracy</footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/edr-letter","query":{},"buildId":"Ef_tfxOR6mGOGMtpgyduM","assetPrefix":"/advocacy-maps","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false}</script><script nomodule="" src="/advocacy-maps/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-990faf1f0129aa2365aa.js"></script><script src="/advocacy-maps/_next/static/chunks/main-4f203d7b748be24394bb.js" async=""></script><script src="/advocacy-maps/_next/static/chunks/webpack-d00b9dcb3ff6d835cc6f.js" async=""></script><script src="/advocacy-maps/_next/static/chunks/framework.063aa3bdfe26ed722714.js" async=""></script><script src="/advocacy-maps/_next/static/chunks/0eceb729.70ab9cc1d0a3efe7f717.js" async=""></script><script src="/advocacy-maps/_next/static/chunks/146c5244.bbb99a9033920b4fc3df.js" async=""></script><script src="/advocacy-maps/_next/static/chunks/f6078781a05fe1bcb0902d23dbbb2662c8d200b3.4760ee52b687d26b2e8e.js" async=""></script><script src="/advocacy-maps/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-c179e70a2b8cb3677d19.js" async=""></script><script src="/advocacy-maps/_next/static/chunks/184f5f3fff7ceb55b8d11941ccb297236e561340.ab89f26289909c3d3d45.js" async=""></script><script src="/advocacy-maps/_next/static/chunks/pages/edr-letter-6d4e12360bfb8016cd08.js" async=""></script><script src="/advocacy-maps/_next/static/Ef_tfxOR6mGOGMtpgyduM/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/advocacy-maps/_next/static/Ef_tfxOR6mGOGMtpgyduM/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
