          MAPLE uses machine translation to make the legislative process more
          accessible to non-native English speakers. Both our website content
          and the testimonies we post can be automatically translated to any
          language on demand, meaning that non-English speakers can write
          testimony in the language in which they are most comfortable and
          legislative offices can click a button to translate it to English.
          While machine translation is not perfect, it offers a big step forward
          in language accessibility for constituents who do not have access to
          expert translation.
