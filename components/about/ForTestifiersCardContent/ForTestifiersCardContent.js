          convene three committees to hear public testimony on the policy
          changes that bill proposes. Don&apos;t miss out on the chance to make
          your perspective heard; submit your testimony to use your voice to
          shape public policy for our Commonwealth.

          Both our website content and the testimonies we post can be
          automatically translated to any language on demand, so non-English
          speakers can write testimony in any language and legislators can click
          a button to automatically translate it to English. While machine
          translation is not perfect, it offers a big step forward in language
          accessibility for testifiers who do not have access to expert
          translation.
