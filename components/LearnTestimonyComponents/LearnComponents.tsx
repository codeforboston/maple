        To Write Effective Testimony

        All laws passed by state legislatures should consider feedback from
        residents and community stakeholders. In Massachusetts, one way to have
        your voice heard is by submitting written testimony regarding specific
        bills. <br /> <br /> This website, the MAPLE platform, can help you
        submit your written testimony to the MA Legislature. However, please
        note that this is not an official government website and is not the only
        way to submit your testimony. Here are the essential things to know
        before submitting testimony:

        By speaking up, you can make the laws of Massachusetts work better for
        all of us! <br /> <br /> Everyone is able to convey their opinions to
        the legislature, but the process to submit testimony can be confusing
        and intimidating. We hope that this website, the MAPLE platform, will
        make that process easier, more straightforward, and more accessible to
        all stakeholders.

        The basics of writing effective testimony are to clearly outline what
        bill you are testifying about, whether you support or oppose it, why you
        are concerned about the issue, what policy you would like to see
        enacted, and what legislative district you live in. Here are some tips
        you can use to make sure the testimony you submit is as impactful as
        possible:
