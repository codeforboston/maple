      By creating an accessible platform for submitting testimony on legislation

          A core goal of the MAPLE platform (this website) is to increase the
          transparency of the legislative process in MA. In short, we want to
          know what information the Legislature considered when reaching a
          conclusion about a bill.{" "}

          Today, there is no legal obligation for the Legislature to disclose
          what written testimony they receive and, in practice, such disclosure
          very rarely happens. As a result, it can be difficult to compare
          legislative outcomes to the interests and demands of constituents,
          which is an important tenant of accountability for legislators.{" "}

          When you submit testimony via the MAPLE platform, you can publish it
          in a freely accesible online database (this website) so that all other
          stakeholders can read your perspective. We hope this will increase the
          overall transparency of the legislative process and lead to better
          policy outcomes, with greater alignment to the needs, values, and
          objectives of the population of Massachusetts. While you certainly do
          not have to submit testimony via this website, we hope you will. Every
          piece of testimony published to this site increases the transparency
          of the legislative process.
