        <h1>The Basics</h1>
        All laws passed by state legislatures should be informed by feedback
        from residents and community stakeholders. In Massachusetts, among other
        ways to have your voice heard, you can submit written testimony to the
        legislature regarding specific bills. This website, the MAPLE platform,
        can help facilitate your submission of written testimony to the MA
        Legislature. However, please note that this is not an official
        government website and you do not need to use this platform to submit
        your testimony. Here are the essential things to know before submitting
        testimony,
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Who</b>: <em>Anyone can submit testimony</em> to the MA
            legislature. Legislators tend to value testimony most when it comes
            from their own constituents, so testimony from MA residents is
            typically directed to both the committee that is substantively
            responsible for the bill as well as the legislators (House member
            and Senator) representing your district.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>What</b>: Your testimony will be most impactful when it feels{" "}
            <em>distinctive and relevant</em>, so be sure to write your own text
            and explain why you are interested in an issue.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>When</b>: Committees generally accept testimony up until the{" "}
            <em>hearing date designated for a bill</em>. You can use the bill
            pages on this website to identify relevant committee dates. Although
            some committees will accept testimony after this date, for the
            greatest impact you should submit your testimony before the hearing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Where</b>: Testimony is generally accepted by{" "}
            <em>committees of the legislature</em> by sending an email to their
            Chairs. This website, MAPLE, will help you to do this by making it
            easy to find a bill you want to testify in and then generate an
            email, which you fully control, which you can then send to the
            relevant personnel.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Why</b>: The key role of testimony is to let your legislators
            know how you feel about an issue. If you don't share your
            perspective, it may not be taken into account when policymakers make
            decisions about the laws that govern all our lives.

        <h1>Understanding the Massachusetts Legislative Process</h1>
        <h2>How a bill becomes a law</h2>
        Some of the key steps in the legislative process for most laws in MA
        are,
        <ol>
          <li>
            Filing. A Representative, Senator, or the Governor must file a bill.
            Constituents can write to their legislators (typically their own
            district's House or Senate member) to propose a bill to be filed.
            This can be done at any time, but is typically done before the start
            of the legislative session (i.e. before the third Friday in January
            of odd-numbered years). Bills filed later, during the legislative
            session, require special approval.
          </li>
          <li>
            Testimony! All stakeholders have the chance to share their thoughts
            with the legislature by submitting written testimony. Typically,
            testimony is submitted to the legislative Committee responsible for
            the bill in advance of their public hearing. You can also deliver
            oral testimony by attending a hearing or you can reach out to your
            legislators and speak to them directly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Public hearing. All bills are formally heard by committees during
            public hearings which are open to the public and recorded and posted
            as videos on the legislature's website. While the amount of time
            available to speak during a public hearing is limited, more detailed
            comments can be submitted to the committee in written testimony.
          </li>
          <li>
            Committee reports. Committees must file reports on each bill under
            their consideration after discussing them in Executive Session
            following the public hearing. This typically occurs before February
            of the second year of the legislative session (even-numbered years).
            The goal for proponents of a bill is that the Committee will
            recommend they "ought to pass" and thereby promote them out of the
            Committee. Most bills, however, are "sent to study," meaning that
            they will not be passed out of committee in that session. A
            successful bill may be redrafted or amended by the committee based
            on testimony received and other deliberations. Many of those bills
            will be refiled in the next session and can be considered again.
          </li>
          <li>
            Three readings. Each bill passed out of Committee will be "read"
            three times by each branch, the House and Senate. This typically
            entails floor debate of the full chamber and a vote of the Committee
            on Ways and Means or Steering and Policy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Engrossment and Enactment. After the three readings, the bill will
            be voted on by each of the full chambers (House and Senate),
            resulting in (if successful) "engrossment" and then "enactment."
          </li>
          <li>
            Conference Committee. If necessary, differences between the House
            and Senate versions of a bill will be reconciled by a temporary
            Conference Committee appointed by the House Speaker and Senate
            President.
          </li>
          <li>
            Executive branch. Lastly, the Governor is responsible for signing
            the enacted and reconciled bill into law. The governor can also veto
            the bill, return it to the Legislature for changes, or take a number
            of other less-common actions.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>The role of testimony</h2>
        Your voice is instrumental to the legislative process and should guide
        both the agenda of the legislature, what topics and bills they consider,
        and their votes, how they decide to act on each bill. Your voice can
        inform legislators of the benefits or negative consequences of proposed
        policies and give them insight into their potential popularity. You can
        also recommend specific changes or improvements to legislation, whether
        you generally support or oppose the bill. By speaking up, you can make
        the laws of Massachusetts work better for all of us! While everyone is
        able to convey their opinions to the legislature, not everyone does. The
        process to submit testimony can be confusing, intimidating, and
        difficult. We hope that this website, the MAPLE platform, will make that
        process more straightforward, more accessible to all stakeholders, and
        easier.
        <h1>Communicating with Legislators</h1>
        There are multiple ways for you to voice your opinion to your
        legislators, including,
        <ul>
          <li>
            Testify in writing! You can submit your thoughts on a bill to the
            Committee hearing it before the date of their public hearing. This
            website, the MAPLE platform, focuses on this mechanism.
          </li>
          <li>
            Testify orally. You can attend a public hearing for a bill of
            interest to you and sign up for a slot to speak before the
            Committee.
          </li>
          <li>
            Write to or call them. You can contact your legislators any time by{" "}
            <a href="https://malegislature.gov/search/findmylegislator">
              looking up their contact information on the MA Legislature website
            </a>
            . Your voice will probably carry the most weight with the House and
            Senate representatives of your own district, but you are free to
            contact Committee Chairs or any other member of the legislature with
            your opinions. You could request a meeting in person.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Writing Effective Testimony</h2>
        The basics of writing effective testimony are to clearly outline what
        bill you are testifying about, whether you support or oppose it, why you
        are concerned about the issue, what policy you would like to see
        enacted, and what legislative district you live in. Here are some tips
        you can use to make sure the testimony you submit is as impactful as
        possible,
        <ul>
          <li>
            Be timely. Written testimony should be targeted towards specific
            bills being considered by the legislature. All Committees should
            formally accept testimony on each bill in the time between the start
            of the legislative session and the public hearing of that bill. Some
            committees will continue accepting testimony after the hearing date,
            but it may not have the same impact on their deliberations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be original. Legislators receive a lot of form letters and repeated
            sentiments from organized groups of constituents. These
            communications are important and their volume can be meaningful to
            legislators. But, almost always, an individual and personalized
            letter will have a greater impact.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be informative. Whether you are a longtime advocate or a first time
            testifier, whether you have a doctoral degree in the subject or
            lived experience regarding a policy, and no matter your age, race,
            creed, or background, your testimony is important. Explain why you
            are concerned about an issue and why you think one policy choice
            would be better than another. For example, your being a parent gives
            you special insight into education policy, your living in a
            community affected by pollution gives you special insight into
            environmental policy, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be direct. State whether you support or oppose a bill. Be clear and
            specific about the policies you want to see. You don't have to know
            specific legal precedents or legislative language; just explain what
            you would like to happen and why.
          </li>
          <li>
            Of course, be respectful. No matter how strongly and sincerely held
            your position is, there may be people of good intent who feel
            oppositely and expect and deserve to have their opinions considered
            by their legislators also. Respectful testimony will carry more
            weight with legislators, especially those who you may need to
            persuade to your side of an issue.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Why transparency matters</h1>A core goal of the MAPLE platform (this
        website) is to increase the transparency of the legislative process in
        MA. In short, we want to know what information the Legislature
        considered when reaching a conclusion about a bill. Today, there is no
        legal obligation for the Legislature to disclose what written testimony
        they receive and, in practice, such disclosure very rarely happens. As a
        result, it can be difficult to compare legislative outcomes to the
        interests and demands of constituents, which is an important tenant of
        accountability for legislators. When you submit testimony via the MAPLE
        platform, you can publish it in a freely accesible online database (this
        website) so that all other stakeholders can read your perspective. We
        hope this will increase the overall transparency of the legislative
        process and lead to better policy outcomes, with greater alignment to
        the needs, values, and objectives of the population of Massachusetts.
        While you certainly do not have to submit testimony via this website, we
        hope you will. Every piece of testimony published to this site increases
        the transparency of the legislative process.
