/**
 * The root React component of the application. Next.js renders this, passing
 * the component of the current page. When you navigate to a new page, Next.js
 * performs client-side routing by re-rendering this component with the new
 * page's component. Generally we want to persist providers and layouts between
 * pages, so they are rendered directly inside the app component rather than
 * inside a page component. This allows react to only remount the page content.
 *
 * See https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/layouts for the pattern.
