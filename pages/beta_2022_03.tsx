        Help us make the policymaking process in Massachusetts more accessible
        and transparent! We are looking for beta testers to share feedback on
        our beta version of the Massachusetts Archive of Transparent Testimony
        (MATT) platform so that we can make it as useful as possible to the
        Commonwealth.
        <h2>When is the beta testing period?</h2>
        The beta testing period runs <b>April 11-22, 2022</b>. We also welcome
        feedback before or after that time!
        <h2>Who can help?</h2>
        Pretty much anyone who cares about public policy in Massachusetts! We
        are seeking a small group of beta testers with diverse interests,
        backgrounds, and experience levels. We would like to have representation
        among community advocates and activists, lobbyists, legislative staff,
        and anyone else who interacts with (or would like to start interacting
        with!) the legislative process.
        <h2>What you'll do</h2>
        The beta testing process should take about 30-60 min of your time and
        can be done anytime during the beta testing period - it's a very small,
        flexible commitment. Beta testers will be asked to perform a small
        number of essential tasks on the beta version of the MATT platform
        related to viewing information about bills and submitting and accessing
        written testimony. We will use an online form to collect your feedback
        about these interactions and may ask to do a brief Zoom interview to
        hear more about your experience.
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        To get involved in the public beta, please email project co-lead Nathan
        Sanders at{" "}
